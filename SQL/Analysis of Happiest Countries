-- Key Insights
-- Top Happiest Countries: Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, and Iceland rank among the top, primarily due to high levels of social support and life expectancy.
-- Regions and Happiness: European countries generally have higher happiness scores, likely due to high GDP per capita, strong social support systems, and low perceptions of corruption.
-- Drivers of Happiness: Initial analysis indicates a strong correlation between happiness and GDP per capita, social support, and freedom to make life choices. Interestingly, generosity and perceptions of corruption seem to have weaker direct correlations with happiness but are still important factors.
-- Opportunities for Further Exploration: Deeper statistical analysis using Python or R could further uncover the extent to which each factor (GDP, social support, etc.) contributes to overall happiness.
